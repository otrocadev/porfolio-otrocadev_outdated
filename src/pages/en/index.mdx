        Let me tell you what I've been doing with the **Digital Solutions team at 
        Wallbox**.

        My main goal was to build a platform to manage the **SIM cards** connected to
        specific models of the company's electric vehicle chargers. 🚗⚡️ This tool was
        established in a secure VPN environment within a larger team tool.

        💼🔒 **Here's a breakdown of how I made it possible:**

        - 🛠️ The first step was to **create a custom Backend using TypeScript**. This
        allowed us to access all useful information details, enabling us to manage the
        SIM card operations with ease.

        - 💻 Once the Backend was ready, I focused on **developing the Frontend**. I ensured
        it was flexible and usable on all devices, and ready to adapt to the needs the
        team might encounter in the field. Additionally, it was built using SOLID
        principles, so it can grow and evolve with the team's needs. The technology
        used for this part was **Vue.js**, and it has been smooth since then.

        🔄 Throughout the process, I was able to learn and enhance some of the most
        tried-and-true software engineering techniques. I used AGILE methods and
        numerous one-on-one meetings with our product owners and project manager to
        ensure everything ran smoothly. This way, we ensured the project met all the
        requirements and fit the team's needs.

        <h5 class="border-2 rounded w-fit p-4 m-6 font-bold">
            ¿Why did this tool had <span class="text-otrocadev-lightblue">A REAL IMPACT</span>?
        </h5>

        Once completed, the company's engineers and technicians had a **solid software
        solution** to rely on while working in the real world, with real-world situations.

        With this flexibility, any software team that comes later can modify, expand,
        and improve the base product to suit any arising needs.

        👋🏼 Greetings! I'm Ot, a **software developer** established near Barcelona.

        My speciality is **the Front-End of web development**, but
        sometimes **I do Back-End stuff** too when needed. I am proactive,
        and I like to learn from new technologies to add value. That is why I
        am currently pursuing a **Bachelor's Degree in Techniques for Software
        Application Development**
        at
        <a
            href="https://blogs.uoc.edu/informatica/es/bachelors-degree-in-techniques-for-software-development/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">UOC</a>.

        I feel very **comfortable in team environments**, as I believe
        that diverse perspectives and opinions usually come together to
        create a better final result. As someone who believes in continuous
        growth, I am convinced that **being part of a team is always an opportunity
        to add value** while you learn new things.

        **I like to say:**
        <blockquote>
        *"It is obvious that a senior will for sure teach a lot of things
        to a Junior, but what is actually crazy, is how a senior can learn
        a lot of new things from a junior. It is a symbiosis that creates
        really special synergies."*
